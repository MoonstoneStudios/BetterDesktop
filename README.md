# BetterDesktop
Make your desktop icons stand out by adding a colored box beneath them!

## Why Should I Use BetterDesktop?
BetterDesktop was created to increase the contrast of the icons on your desktop.
Lost of people have known the feeling of finding the ✨perfect wallpaper✨, just to have it make the desktop icons hard to see.
That is why I created BetterDesktop!

## Features
- Render a colored box below desktop icons, making them pop out.
- Customize the box's color and alpha.
- Start the app on system startup.
- Group icons into neat rectangles for an organized look.
- Minimize to system tray on close.
- System tray icon to exit the app or show the window.
- Shift + exiting app with ❌ button will always quit the app, regardless of the system tray setting.
